* Estimates from Vaughan /et al/ (2020)

Following from Vaughan /et al/ (2020) we assume that the rate of becoming
un-infectious is \(1/10\) (where time is measured in days). This subsumes the
three ways in which individuals can cease to be infectious: recovery/death,
sampling and occurrence. Plausible values of \(R_0\) range from 1.4 to 2.8. That
analysis only considered genomic data so we cannot use their results to inform
an occurrence rate, but it seems reasonable that this would be roughly similar
to the sampling rate or higher.

Some key figures from Vaughan /et al/ (2020) are included below

An important caveat to the results in this manuscript is that it appears that
there is "the presense of unsequenced pathgen diversity in these populations."
The unsequenced diversity would explain why they tend to underestimate the total
number of cases. Although the estimates of \(R_0\), which is the main focus of
the paper, appear highly robust.

Using WebPlotDigitizer we extracted the following values from these figures.

* Derived parameters

We will use the estimates of \(R_0\) above and the assumption of a becoming
uninfectious rate of \(1/10\) as our parameters. Since we have the total number
of confirmed cases, we can use this to get an updated sampling rate. Dividing
the number of sequenced samples by the total number of cases gives us our
estimate of the sampling proportion. It is difficult to know what proportion of
cases will be observed so we set the occurrence and death rates to be equal.
Solving the resulting set of equations gives the following parameter values.

| Outbreak  | Birth rate | Death rate | Sampling rate | Occurrence rate |
|-----------+------------+------------+---------------+-----------------|
| Australia |      0.185 |      0.046 |         0.008 |           0.046 |
