* Prevalence CI Calibration

This simulation study tests the coverage of the CI under the NB approximation.
It does this using the application =simulation-study-aggregated-observations=
with a set of suitable configuration files.

** Example results

*** Prevalence at present

[[./replication-results-prevalence.png]]

*** Basic reproduction number

Here are the \(95\%\) credible intervals for the basic reproduction number in
each of the replicates. The dashed line indicates the true value used in the
simulations.

*** ESS as MCMC diagnostic

The following figure shows the ESS for each of the parameters in each replicate
as calculated by =coda=, the dashed line indicates an effective sample size of
200 which is a standard threshold used in the phylodynamics literature.

** Usage

There is a script =run.sh= to run the replication study and a script =clean.sh=
to remove the results of previous runs.

#+begin_src sh :tangle run.sh
# run.sh
#
# This must be run with bash!!!

Rscript generate-config-files.R $NUM_SEEDS

pids=()

for ix in $(seq 1 $NUM_SEEDS);
do
    stack exec -- simulation-study-aggregated-observations out/seed-$ix/config-$ix.json && echo "Finished $ix" & pids+=($!)
done

wait "${pids[@]}"
