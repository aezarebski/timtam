* Prevalence CI Calibration

This simulation study tests the coverage of the CI under the NB approximation.
It does this using the application =simulation-study-aggregated-observations=
with a set of suitable configuration files.

- [X] Write a configuration file to generate a single CI.
- [X] Visualise the single estimate and the true value in the simulation
- [X] Repeat the above two steps multiple times
