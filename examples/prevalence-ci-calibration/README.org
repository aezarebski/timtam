* Prevalence CI Calibration

This simulation study tests the coverage of the CI under the NB approximation.
It does this using the application =simulation-study-aggregated-observations=
with a set of suitable configuration files which each live in a subdirectory or
=out=.

** Example results

*** Prevalence at present

[[./replication-results-prevalence-bias.png]]

*** Basic reproduction number

Here are the \(95\%\) credible intervals for the basic reproduction number in
each of the replicates. The dashed line indicates the true value used in the
simulations.

*** ESS as MCMC diagnostic

The following figure shows the ESS for each of the parameters in each replicate
as calculated by =coda=, the dashed line indicates an effective sample size of
200 which is a standard threshold used in the phylodynamics literature.

** Usage

There is a script =run.sh= to run the replication study and a script =clean.sh=
to remove the results of previous runs. Note that =run.sh= needs to be run with
bash rather than just =sh= for the parallelism to work. The computation is split
up into groups of 10 to avoid using up all the resources at once and crashing my
machine. You will need to manually adjust this to have the correct loops if you
want to change the settings.

*WARNING* if you have not compiled, you will need to run =stack build= before
hand.

#+begin_src sh :tangle run.sh
# run.sh
#
# This must be run with bash!!!
