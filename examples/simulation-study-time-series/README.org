* Simulation Study Time Series

See =run.sh= for the steps involved in running this example. There is a script
=clean.sh= which can be used to clean up intermediate files.

This simulates a data set and then takes portions of the data based on what had
been observed at several points in the simulation. It then evaluaes
log-likelihood profiles both about the actual parameters used in the simulation
and about a MLE estimate of the parameters. The resulting figures appear in
=out/=.

The =src= directory contains some helpful R scripts for both the configuration
of the simulation study and the visualisation of results. The configuration of
this program is stored in =ts-config.json= but it is a bit verbose so its
construction is managed by =src/make-json-config.R=.

** Example

[[./out/prevalence-profiles.png]]

The estimates of the prevalence through time based on both the true parameters
used in the simulation and the estimated values.

[[./out/llhd-profiles-11.00.png]]

The LLHD profiles based on the final data set collected.
