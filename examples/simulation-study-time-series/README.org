* Simulation Study Time Series

See =run.sh= for the steps involved in running this example. This simulates a
data set and then takes portions of the data based on what had been observed at
several points in the simulation. It then evaluaes log-likelihood profiles both
about the actual parameters used in the simulation and about a MLE estimate of
the parameters. The resulting figures appear in =out/=.

The =src= directory contains some helpful R scripts for both the configuration
of the simulation study and the visualisation of results. The configuration of
this program is stored in =ts-config.json= but it is a bit verbose so its
construction is managed by =src/make-json-config.R=.

** Example

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[./out/prevalence-profiles.png]]

The estimates of the prevalence through time based on both the true parameters
used in the simulation and the estimated values.

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[./out/llhd-profiles-16p00.png]]

The LLHD profiles based on the final data set collected.

** Running this simulation study

To build the executable use =stack build=. The rest of the computation is driven
by =run.sh=. To clean up remove the contents of =out/= and remove
=ts-config.json= there is a =clean.sh= script.

* Super weird bug!

Using the inference times specified by =inference_times <- c(32.6,32.7)= in
=src/make-json-config.R= causes the likelihood to behave very strangely with
only a very minor change to the data. It is very unclear what is going on
here...
