* Simulation Study of Aggregated Observations

This simulation study looks at the loss of information when unscheduled data is
aggregated into scheduled observations.

** Running the simulation study

The running of this simulation study is coordinated by the script =run.sh=. The
contents of that file are given below. The simulation study is specified in a
JSON file which is given as a command line argument. The R script
=make-json-config.R= produces this so you don't need to edit it manually.

=run.sh=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle run.sh
Rscript src/make-json-config.R

stack build
stack exec -- simulation-study-aggregated-observations agg-app-config.json

Rscript src/plot.R
#+END_SRC

Note that there is an assumption here that every occurrence event that occurs
after the last unscheduled sequenced sample is removed before the aggregation
step.
