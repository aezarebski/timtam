#+title: Simulating data with ape

There is a =run.sh= script to carry out this computation. It uses the [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html][=ape=]]
package in R to simulate a birth-death process and then randomly annotate the
tips to produce a sample from the BDSCOD process.

* Simulation script

The following demonstrates how to use the =ape-sim.R= script

#+begin_src sh
./ape-sim.R --seed 1 -p ../example-parameters.json -o out --duration 30.0 
#+end_src
