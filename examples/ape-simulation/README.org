#+title: Simulating data with ape

There is a =run.sh= script to carry out this computation. It uses the [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html][=ape=]]
package in R to simulate a birth-death process and then randomly annotate the
tips to produce a sample from the BDSCOD process. The results of this can be
viewed by opening =index.html= in a browser.
