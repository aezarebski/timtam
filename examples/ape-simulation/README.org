#+title: Simulating data with ape

There is a makefile to carry out this computation. It uses the [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html][=ape=]] package in
R to simulate a birth-death process and then randomly annotate the tips to
produce a sample from the BDSCOD process. Run =make index.html= then open this
file with your browser. To remove old files use =make clean=.
