* Simulation studies

There are a couple of simulation studies. See the following files for details.

- =examples/simulation-study/README.md=
- =examples/simulation-study-time-series/README.org=
- =examples/simulation-study-aggregated-observations/README.org=
- =examples/prevalence-ci-calibration/README.org=

* Measuring evaluation times

See =examples/timing-evaluation/README.org= for details of a simulation study in
which the evaluation speed of the likelihood is measured for a range of data
sets.

* Parameters

In =aggregated-observations=, =ci-calibration= and =timing-evaluation= a common
set of parameters are used for the unscheduled events.

| Parameter       | Value |
|-----------------+-------|
| birth rate      |   1.7 |
| death rate      |   0.9 |
| sampling rate   |  0.05 |
| occurrence rate |  0.25 |

** TODO Re-run Aggregated Observations with correct parameters
** TODO Re-run CI Calibration with correct parameters
** TODO Re-run Timing Evaluation with correct parameters
