* Simulation studies

There are a couple of simulation studies. See the following files for details.

- =examples/simulation-study/README.md=
- =examples/simulation-study-time-series/README.org=
- =examples/simulation-study-aggregated-observations/README.org=
- =examples/prevalence-ci-calibration/README.org=

* Measuring evaluation times

See =examples/timing-evaluation/README.org= for details of a simulation study in
which the evaluation speed of the likelihood is measured for a range of data
sets.

* Parameters

In =aggregated-observations=, =ci-calibration= and =timing-evaluation= a common
set of parameters are used for the unscheduled events. These values are stored
in =example-parameters.json= so they can be read from a single source.
