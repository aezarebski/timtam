#+title: BDSCOD

This repository contains an implementation of the approximate likelihood of a
birth-death process with various observation processes described [[https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.21.349068][here]]. See
=examples/README.org= for a description of some of the examples included in this
repository.

* Computational environment

R is used for visualisation and some scripting. See the =shell.nix= file to
recreate the R environment. In the evaluation of the computation time there are
some python scripts that need to be run. There is a =requirements.txt= file
which specifies a python virtual environment for that.
