# BDSCOD

This package defines the approximate likelihood of a birth-death process with
various observation processes.

## Running the Manceau example

See `examples/manceau-comparison/README.md` for details of the comparison

## Simulation study

See `examples/simulation-study/README.md` for details of the simulation study.

## Evaluation timing

See `examples/timing-evaluation/README.md` for details of a simulation study
looking at the evaluation speed of the likelihood.
