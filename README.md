# BDSCOD

This package defines the approximate likelihood of a birth-death process with
various observation processes.

## Running the Manceau example

See `examples/manceau-comparison/README.md` for details of the comparison

## Simulation studies

There are a couple of simulation studies; see the following files for details.

- `examples/simulation-study/README.md`
- `examples/simulation-study-time-series/README.md`
- `examples/simulation-study-aggregated-observations/README.org`

## Evaluation timing

See `examples/timing-evaluation/README.md** for details of a simulation study
looking at the evaluation speed of the likelihood.

## R environment

R is used for visualisation and some scripting. See the `shell.nix` file to
recreate the R environment.
